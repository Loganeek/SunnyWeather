In this file you can see 3 main sections :

build-and-test
static-analysis
generate-release-apk
CI workflow chaining

The build-and-test part is in charge of building application (and check for build failure) and running tests, both unit and instrumented. For instrumented it used android-emulator-runner to prepare a device in order to run. At the end a Jacoco task is merging different coverage result and upload them to Codacy

In parallel of this task, static-analysis is running some of android popular linters : ktLint, detekt, Android lint, Spotless

The last task generate-release-apk is waiting for build-and-test to complete and succeed before running then it will try to build an releaseable apk without publish it.

The real publishing task is in the Release Workflow which do the same job but in an other part of the delivery workflow, when a new version-tag is added. You can notice that the workflow deploy the final apk to firebase through firebase-app-distribution task.

Finally the *.apk file is available to Firebase App Distribution
App distribution ready to serve
